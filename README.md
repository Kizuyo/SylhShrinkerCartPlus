# Shrinker Cart Plus

**A mod for R.E.P.O. that dynamically shrinks objects inside carts.**

## 💡 Key Features

- ✅ **Smooth scaling**: no instant size changes – everything shrinks gently.
- ✅ **Safe limits**: avoids making large objects too small.
- ✅ **Restoration**: once an object leaves the cart, it gradually returns to its original size.
- ✅ **Configuration**: You can change multiple things !

Enjoy smoother carts and cleaner gameplay. No more massive furniture bouncing out like a possessed fridge. 😉

# ChangeLog
### v0.0.8
- 🎯 Added the ability to configure the **maximum number of Enemy Valuable** drops, allowing more loot to spawn when enemies are defeated — especially useful when shrinking them!

## v0.0.7
- 🚀 Added a configuration menu to customize mod settings and fine-tune your experience.

## v0.0.6
- 🐛 Fixed a bug preventing objects from returning to their original size after being removed from the cart.
- 🚀 Improved performance by shrinking only new or currently shrinking objects, instead of iterating over the entire cart content every frame.
