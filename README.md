# Sylh Shrinker Cart Plus

**A mod for R.E.P.O. that dynamically shrinks objects inside carts.**

## 💡 Key Features

- ✅ **Smooth scaling**: no instant size changes – everything shrinks gently.
- ✅ **Safe limits**: avoids making large objects too small.
- ✅ **Restoration**: once an object leaves the cart, it gradually returns to its original size.
- ✅ **Configuration**: You can change multiple things !
- ✅ **Only Valuable**: Only valuable will be shrinks, so you can still using C.A.R.T Cannon & Laser
- ✅ **Also change the mass**: You can activate an option to adjust the mass of shrunk objects inside the cart !

Enjoy smoother carts and cleaner gameplay. No more massive furniture bouncing out like a possessed fridge. 😉
